				<li>300 ml coconut cream</li>

				<li>2 tsp tamarind puree</li>
				<li>350g prawns/shrimp</li>

			<ul>
				<li>16 Thai basil leaves</li>
				<li>1 red chilli</li>
				<li>2 tbsp crispy fried shallots</li>
				<li>Jasmine rice</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Instructions</h3>
		
			<h4>Curry Paste</h4>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Soak dried chillis</strong>: Roughly chop chillies and transfer to bowl, leaving behind seeds. Cover with boiling water and soak for 30 minutes then drain (reserve soaking water).</li>

				<li><strong>Check spiciness</strong>: Have a nibble of soaked chilli, should not be that spicy. If it is spicy, only use 1/3 to 1/2 of the amount (Note 1).</li>
			
				<li><strong>Prepare lemongrass</strong>: Remove woody top half and outer layers of lemongrass. Grate with microplane. (See in post or video for preparation demo)</li>

				<li><strong>Make curry paste</strong>: Place chillis, lemongrass and all remaining curry paste ingredients in a jar just wide enough to fit a stick blender. Add 3 tablespoons chilli soaking water. Blitz with stick blender until smooth so there's no hard grit – rub between your fingers to check – about 15 seconds on high. (Or use small food processor or Nutribullet, scraping down sides well).</li>

			</ol>

			<h4><Curry</h4>

			<ol>
				<li><strong>Cook off curry paste</strong>: Heat oil in a medium heavy based skillet over medium heat. (Mine is a 26cm / 10.5" Lodget cast iron) Add curry paste and cook for 3 to 4 minutes until it dries out a bit a smells fragrant.</li>

				<li><strong>Reduce stock</strong>: Add chicken stock, stir to dissolve paste, then simmer for 1 minute.</li>
				<li><strong>Add remaining curry sauce ingredients</li>: Reduce heat to medium low. Add tamarind, fish sauce and sugar. Stir until tamarind is dissolved. Then stir in coconut, carrot and potato. </li>

				<li><strong>Simmer</strong>: Bring to simmer, then simmer gently for 15 minutes or until potato is almost fully soft. Pierce with knife to check, it might take 20 minutes.</li>

				<li><strong>Prawns and bamboo shoots</strong>: Add prawns and bamboo shoots. Stir, then cook for 3 minutes until prawns are just cooked.</li>

				<li><strong>ADJUST sauce</strong>: Taste and adjust the curry sauce at this point. Thin sauce with stock or water, add salt, fish sauce or sugar if needed.</li>

				<li><strong>Serve!</strong> Transfer curry to serving bowl. Garnish with Thai Basil, fresh chilli and crispy shallots. Serve with jasmine rice.</li>

			</ol>
